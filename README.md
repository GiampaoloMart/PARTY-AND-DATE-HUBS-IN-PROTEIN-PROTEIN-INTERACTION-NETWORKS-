# Party and date hubs

Integration of Topological Properties and Gene Expression in E. coli Interactome

## Overview

This project focuses on the integration of two topological properties, degree and betweenness centrality, to define hubness and bottleneckness, respectively. The goal is to analyze an interactome for E. coli along with a gene expression compendium. The analysis categorizes nodes into four distinct categories and explores the concept of party and date hubs.


## Introduction

In this project, we aim to integrate topological properties derived from the E. coli interactome. The two key properties are:
- **Degree:** Defines hubness in the network.
- **Betweenness Centrality:** Defines bottleneckness in the network.

The analysis categorizes nodes into four groups based on these properties and explores the concept of party and date hubs.

## Installation

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GiampaoloMart/PARTY-AND-DATE-HUBS-IN-PROTEIN-PROTEIN-INTERACTION-NETWORKS.git
cd PARTY-AND-DATE-HUBS-IN-PROTEIN-PROTEIN-INTERACTION-NETWORKS
